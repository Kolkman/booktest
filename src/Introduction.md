# Introduction

This document serves as an aid for people who are observing the work in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  from a policy-based perspective. We have try to indicate which activities might be of policy interest.

This is not the only curated list for people with other than technical interest of IETF activity. [Article 19 produced a web page](https://almanac.article19.org/orgs/3_ietf.html) with an overview of working groups whose work that has human right considerations.  Also, the IETF itself publishes lists of new topics at IETF meetings e.g. [for IETF 119](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf119-new-topics/). This curration may have some overlap with others. Completeness is neither claimed nor guaranteed.

Earlier we published a word document with the ornithology. We are now experimenting with a github based curration that is easil compiled into a web page or a pdf document and, more importantly, allows for github based collaboration. 

This version of the Ornithology has been last updated for IETF 119.
