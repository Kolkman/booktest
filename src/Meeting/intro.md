# During a meeting

At IETF meeting a number of meetings take place that are of general interest


The IETF plenary is where general administrative reporting takes place and where
discussions are being held that are important to the whole community,
e.g., about how the IETF governs itself.

The IAB Open Meeting is where the Internet Architecture board presents what it is doing. Usually, it includes discussions of topics about the Internet Architecture and an update on liaisons. The latter is interesting as it provides an insight as to how the IETF relates to other SDOs and technical bodies. 

[The Internet Research Task Force](https://www.irtf.org/) (IRTF) Open
Meeting is where research topics are
presented and progress in research groups is reported, it also features
presentations of the [Applied Networking Research
Prize](https://irtf.org/anrp/) (ANRP) winners.

The Internet Engineering Protocol Group ([IEPG](https://iepg.org/)), a meeting usually taking place on
Sunday, features somewhat more operational presentations of “topical
interest”. The presentations are technical but usually give an
indication about the topics that are interesting to the Internet
technical infrastructure’s operational community.

Further, the Tutorial: New Participants’ Overview is relevant for newcommers while during the Hot RFC session participants try to pitch their documents to make sure interested parties join sessions later in the week.

Finally, the Technology Deep Dive is a mini masterclass for the technical IETF audience on a specific topic.
