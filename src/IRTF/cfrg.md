# Crypto Forum (cfrc)
* [CFRG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/cfrg/about/)


  Although highly technical, the cfrg is the place where almost all cryptographic building blocks that are used in IETF protocols are  evaluated. The open and peer reviewed nature of this work is critical for the security across the Internet â€“ as such the existence of the group is of policy interest.
