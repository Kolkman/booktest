Digital credentials based on IETF standards (and standards in other SDOs) have use cases ranging from individual credentials, such as driverâ€™s licenses, age-verification, and vaccination proofs, to business-to-business or business-to-government application. One example is fraud and counterfeiting prevention in cross-border trade documents by protecting digital representations of mill test reports, bills of materials, bills of lading, or commercial invoices. In order to meet privacy, security, and sustainability objectives, digital credentials need to be designed with awareness of computation and storage constraints associated with their use cases.

SPICE aims to document digital credential formats based on existing  IETF standards, and extend them to support stakeholders that are building compliance and automation systems based on industry adopted ryptography and protocols.
