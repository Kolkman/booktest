# Workload Identity in Multi System Environments (wimse)


* [bof request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-richer-wimse/)
* Keywords: Identity, cloud service

Currently, identification of workloads that provide services and identification of humans in interaction with services are done using two different protocols (SPIFFEE and OAUTH respectively). The communities associated with these have identified common challenges.

This BOF about forming a working group to identify, articulate, and bridge the gaps and ambiguities in workload identity problems and define solutions across a diverse set of platforms and deployments, building on various protocols used in workload environments.

This work may have aspects related to platform interoperability.
