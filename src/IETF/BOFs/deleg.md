# New DNS Delegations (deleg)

* [Bof request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-arends-deleg-capabilities/)
* Keywords: DNS, core infrastructure, confidentiality


    Within the DNS protocol the NS and DS records are used to signal to clients (resolvers) how the authority to serve and sign information within a specific part of the DNS is delegated. Within the DNS ops working group, there is a need to securely signal new technical capabilities such as the availability of authentication, confidentiality, and/or more efficient transport mechanism. This BoF will help people outside the DNS ecosystem understand how this new form of delegation might affect their use of the DNS. It will be an opportunity to hear already-proposed delegation  capabilities as well as to brainstorm on new capabilities.
