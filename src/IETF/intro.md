# The IETF

The IETF work is organized in working groups that are themselves clustered in areas. There are currently 7 areas.

 
 
  * Internet Area ([int](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ops/about/)) - dealing with IP packets and how to Internetwork
* Routing Area ([rtg](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rtg/about/)) - about how to route those packets.
* Web and Internet Transport ([wit](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/wit/about/)) - provides abstract end to end connections for applications to use.
* Operations and Management Area ([ops](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ops/about/)) - works on managing and operating IP based networks
* Applications and Real-Time Area ([art](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/art/about/)) - provides building blocks for applications
* Security Area ([sec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sec/about/)) - provides security building blocks for it all.
* General Area ([gen](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/gen/about/)) - is about organizing the IETF and it s governance.


The descriptions above are quite informal, more information about Areas can be found on the [IETF Areas webpage](https://www.ietf.org/technologies/areas/)
